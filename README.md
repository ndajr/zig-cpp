Example on how one can integrate [Zig CC](https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html) to build and test C++ applications. Make sure you have Zig installed: `brew install zig`.

## Commands:

- `zig build`: Builds the executable on `./zig-out/bin`;
- `zig build run`: Builds and run the executable;
- `zig build test`: Runs the tests.
